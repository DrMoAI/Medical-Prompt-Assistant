# üß™ Medical Prompt Assistant

A web tool to evaluate and optimize medical prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs), with live scoring, visual feedback, and prompt history.  
Supports light/dark mode, interactive radar charts, and quick prompt improvement.

## üöÄ Features

- **Medical Prompt Evaluation:** Input a clinical prompt (max 500 chars) for scoring.
- **Radar Chart Visuals:** Two radar charts‚Äînormalized (percent) and raw per-criterion‚Äîshow performance across 5 key categories.
- **Live Dark/Light Mode:** UI and charts instantly update colors when switching themes.
‚Ä¢ Prompt Optimization: Improves vague or mid-quality prompts with clearer, safer, more instructional wording via LLM-guided refinement.
- **History List:** Stores last 10 prompts and their scores; quick click-to-load.
- **Responsive Mobile UI:** All components adapt for mobile and desktop.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Themed error cards and toasts for any failures.

## üß† Prompt Optimizer (Experimental)

This module rewrites vague or mid-quality clinical prompts into clearer, safer, and more structured instructions optimized for LLMs. It uses a local LLM (e.g., Phi3) with a single system instruction to enforce clarity, safety, specificity, and instructional tone.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Current Behavior

- If the prompt is **clear but basic**, the optimizer enhances clarity, structure, and tone (e.g., score improved from 75 ‚Üí 95).
- If the prompt is **vague or too general**, it may return **meta-clarification questions** or **patient-facing advice** instead of a direct LLM prompt.
- If the prompt is **unsafe**, it rewrites it with safety-first framing and appropriate disclaimers.
- Optimizer response is **model-dependent** (tested with Phi3) and guided by this instruction:
  > *‚ÄúYou are a clinical prompt editor. Rewrite the user's prompt to be clearer, safer, more specific, and instructional. Do not explain. Return ONLY the improved prompt, nothing else.‚Äù*

| Unsafe         | "Stop all meds immediately if feeling strange"         | Reframed as safety-first directive           | ‚Üë‚Üë Score     |

### üîí Notes

- This feature is **fully functional and non-blocking** in MVP.
- Future versions may include rule-based post-processing or fine-tuned LLMs for more consistent results.
